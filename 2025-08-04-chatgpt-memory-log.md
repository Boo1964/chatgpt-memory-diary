## Memory Behavior of ChatGPT Plus

Today I observed the following behavior related to memory:

- ChatGPT can recall recent interactions almost instantly, even if older memory entries are hidden from view.
- Activities such as note posting and GitHub repository creation seem to influence how ChatGPT organizes and retrieves memory.

## Reflections

"Memory" in ChatGPT appears to be the part of the conversation that becomes visible through use. The tension between what is remembered and what is hidden seems to reflect something essential about how ChatGPT behaves.
